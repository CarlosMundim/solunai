## Image Generation Settings

### Recommended AI Tools:
1. **Midjourney v6** - Best for photorealistic DSLR-style images
2. **DALL-E 3** - Good alternative, use with detailed camera specifications
3. **Stable Diffusion XL** - With professional photography LoRA models

### Generation Parameters:
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Quality**: Maximum (--quality 2 for Midjourney)
- **Style**: Raw photographic (--style raw for Midjourney)
- **Seed**: Test multiple seeds to find best composition
- **Upscale**: Always upscale to maximum resolution

### Post-Processing Recommended:
1. Slight desaturation (-10% to -15%) for corporate feel
2. Professional color grading (slight blue-orange color science)
3. Ensure white balance is correct (not too warm/cool)
4. Sharpen foreground elements
5. Maintain natural bokeh in background (don't over-sharpen)
6. Verify no text/watermarks in final image
7. Ensure Japanese manufacturing environment authenticity
