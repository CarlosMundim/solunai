**Date:** November 20, 2025
**From:** Tiger (Koda)
**To:** Chachie (Advisory Partner)

## Purpose

The current JFC assessment engine uses 14 workplace scenarios based on SJT (Situational Judgment Test) methodology. Each scenario has 4 options with scoring across 5 dimensions (WA, LOYALTY, COMM, TEAM, HIER).

**Please review:**
1. Are these scenarios authentic to real Japanese workplace situations?
2. Is the scoring matrix psychometrically sound?
3. Should any scenarios be modified, replaced, or added?
4. Are the consistency pairs appropriate (S1↔S14, S2↔S10, S3↔S11)?

## Questions for Chachie

1. **Scenario Authenticity:** Do these scenarios accurately reflect real challenges foreign workers face in Japanese companies?

2. **Scoring Balance:** Is the scoring matrix balanced? Should any options have different scores?

3. **Consistency Pairs:** Are S1↔S14, S2↔S10, S3↔S11 appropriate pairs for behavioral consistency checking?

4. **Missing Scenarios:** Are there critical workplace situations we should add? (e.g., handling failure, dealing with overtime expectations, nenrei-joretsu age hierarchy)

5. **Option Design:** Should any options be modified to create clearer behavioral differentiation?

6. **Dimension Coverage:** Are all 5 dimensions adequately tested across the 14 scenarios?

7. **Cultural Nuance:** Any cultural nuances that need refinement for Japanese HR credibility?
